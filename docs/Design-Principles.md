# Blue-Canoe Design Principles (v20250314.1)

**Purpose:**  
The Blue-Canoe Design System ensures that all user-facing materials—websites, emails, documents, and dashboards—are consistent, professional, and easy to maintain. Rooted in the Golden Ratio (1.618), it delivers natural balance, simplicity, and clarity.

## Core Principles

1. **Golden Ratio (1.618)**: Drives all spacing, sizing, and layout logic.
2. **Inter Font Family**: Clean, modern, and professional typeface, with system fallbacks for resilience.
3. **Modular, Versioned CSS**: Flexible for theming, dark mode, and future extensions without altering the base system.
4. **Consistency Across All Interfaces**: Every Blue-Canoe site, tool, and document feels part of the same ecosystem.
5. **Simplicity and Readability**: Prioritizing user understanding over visual clutter.

## How to Use

1. **Include `blue-canoe-base.css`** in all new web projects.
2. **Apply standard classes and utilities** for buttons, forms, layouts, and cards.
3. **Use utility spacing classes** (`gap-small`, `gap-medium`, `gap-large`) to maintain consistent margins and padding.
4. **Extend with theme files** for color or branding variations — don't alter base CSS directly.
5. **Reference this document** for guidance on purpose and correct usage.
